        The HTML <section> element represents a generic section of a document,
        i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.

        Usage notes:
        Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <section> element.

        If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead.

        Do not use the <section> element as a generic container; this is what <div> is for,
        especially when the sectioning is only for styling purposes.
        A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the outline of a document.

                    <p>
                        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
