            <h2>Exclusions</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Exclusions are new in Internet Explorer 10 and Windows Store apps using JavaScript. With CSS Exclusions, web authors can now wrap text so that it completely surrounds elements, thereby avoiding the traditional limitations of floats. Instead of limiting elements to floating either to the left or right relative to their position in the document flow, CSS Exclusions can be positioned at a specified distance from the top, bottom, left, or right sides of a containing block, while remaining part of the document flow.</p>
            <p>Support for CSS Exclusions in Internet Explorer 10 and Windows Store apps using JavaScript enables scenarios like the one illustrated in the following image, where the app shown is laid out similarly to the way in which you might design a page in a desktop publishing application like Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign.</p>
